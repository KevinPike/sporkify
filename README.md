# Sporkify

Sporkify is an application for forking and merging playlists.

## Use cases
* You subscribe to a playlist. You like most songs but you can't stand a few.
Solution: fork it with Sporkify and remove the songs you don't like. Your fork
will continue to receive updates, merging in new songs while giving your subtractions
and additions top priority.
* You like someone else's playlist and want to add it to your own.
Solution: Merge it into yours using Sporkify.
